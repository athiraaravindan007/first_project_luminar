            It's just a moment in time - just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.

            But it's a connection....
            
            We make sure everything we do honors that connection from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.
            
            From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we've been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.
